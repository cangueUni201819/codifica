                Questo progetto è realizzato per il corso di "Codifica dei Testi" a.a. 2018/2019, si tratta della versione elettronica dell'articolo “The Right to Read"
                di Richard M. Stallman, pubblicato nel volume "Free Software, Free Society: Selected Essays of Richard M. Stallman".
                Lo schema di codifica utilizzato è stato ricavato con Tei Roma, partendo dalla base Tei Lite ed aggiungendo il modulo namesdates.
                Per la presentazione sono stati usati i fogli di stile XSL, CSS e BOOTSTRAP 4 per rendere il layout responsivo, mentre per lo smooth scrolling JQuery.
                Passando il mouse sui nomi viene visualizzato il tipo e se o meno si tratti di un abbreviazione.

                    <geogName>Tycho</geogName>,
                    <emph>a collection of articles about the antecedents of theLunarian Revolution, published in
                        <placeName type="phrase">Luna City</placeName> in

                <p>For
                    <persName>Dan Halbert</persName>, the road to
                    <geogName>Tycho</geogName> began in college—when
                    <persName>Lissa Lenz</persName> asked
                        to borrow his computer. Hers had broken down, and unless she could borrow
                        another, she would fail her midterm project. There was no one she dared ask,
                        except
                    <persName>Dan</persName>.

                </p>
                <p>This put
                    <persName>Dan</persName> in a dilemma. He had to help her—but if he lent her his
                        computer, she might read his books. Aside from the fact that you could go to
                        prison for many years for letting someone else read your books, the very idea
                        shocked him at frst. Like everyone, he had been taught since elementary school
                        that sharing books was nasty and wrong—something that only pirates would
                        do.

                </p>
                <p>And there wasn’t much chance that the
                    <orgName type="acronym">SPA</orgName>—the
                    <orgName type="phrase">Software Protection Authority</orgName>—would fail to catch him. In his software class,
                    <persName>Dan</persName> had learned
                        that each book had a copyright monitor that reported when and where it was
                        read, and by whom, to
                    <orgName type="phrase">Central Licensing</orgName>. (They used this information to catch
                        reading pirates, but also to sell personal interest profles to retailers.) The next
                        time his computer was networked,
                    <orgName type="phrase">Central Licensing</orgName> would fnd out. He, as
                        computer owner, would receive the harshest punishment—for not taking pains
                        to prevent the crime.
                    </p>
                <p>Of course,
                    <persName>Lissa</persName> did not necessarily intend to read his books. She might want the computer only to write her midterm. But
                    <persName>Dan</persName> knew she came from a
                        middle-class family and could hardly aﬀord the tuition, let alone her reading fees.
                        Reading his books might be the only way she could graduate. He understood
                        this situation; he himself had had to borrow to pay for all the research papers he
                        read. (Ten percent of those fees went to the researchers who wrote the papers;
                        since
                    <persName>Dan</persName> aimed for an academic career, he could hope that his own research papers, if frequently referenced, would bring in enough to repay this loan.)
                </p>
                <p>Later on,
                    <persName>Dan</persName> would learn there was a time when anyone could go to the library and read journal articles, and even books, without having to pay. There
                        were independent scholars who read thousands of pages without government
                        library grants. But in the
                    <date when="1990">1990s</date>, both commercial and nonproft journal publishers
                        had begun charging fees for access. By
                    <date when="2047">2047</date>, libraries oﬀering free public
                        access to scholarly literature were a dim memory.
                    </p>
                <p>
                   There were ways, of course, to get around the
                    <orgName type="acronym">SPA</orgName> and
                    <orgName type="phrase">Central Licensing</orgName>.They were themselves illegal.
                    <persName>Dan</persName> had had a classmate in software,
                    <persName>Frank Martucci</persName>, who had obtained an illicit debugging tool, and used it to skip over the
                        copyright monitor code when reading books. But he had told too many friends
                        about it, and one of them turned him in to the
                    <orgName type="acronym">SPA</orgName> for a reward (students deep in debt were easily tempted into betrayal). In
                    <date when="2047">2047</date>,
                    <persName>Frank</persName> was in prison, not for pirate reading, but for possessing a debugger.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <persName>Dan</persName> would later learn that there was a time when anyone could have debugging tools.
                        There were even free debugging tools available on CD or downloadable over the net.
                        But ordinary users started using them to bypass copyright
                        monitors, and eventually a judge ruled that this had become their principal use
                        in actual practice. This meant they were illegal; the debuggers’ developers were
                        sent to prison.
                    </p>
                <p>Programmers still needed debugging tools, of course, but debugger vendors in
                    <date when="2047">2047</date> distributed numbered copies only, and only to ofcially licensed and bonded programmers. The debugger
                    <persName>Dan</persName> used in software class was kept behind a special frewall so that it could be used only for class exercises.
                </p>
                <p>It was also possible to bypass the copyright monitors by installing a modifed system kernel.
                    <persName>Dan</persName> would eventually fnd out about the free kernels, even entire
                        free operating systems, that had existed around the turn of the century. But
                        not only were they illegal, like debuggers—you could not install one if you had
                        one, without knowing your computer’s root password. And neither the
                    <orgName type="acronym">FBI</orgName> nor
                    <orgName type="phrase">Microsoft Support</orgName> would tell you that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <persName>Dan</persName> concluded that he couldn’t simply lend
                    <persName>Lissa</persName> his computer. But he
                        couldn’t refuse to help her, because he loved her. Every chance to speak with
                        her flled him with delight. And that she chose him to ask for help, that could
                        mean she loved him too.
                    </p>
                <p>
                    <persName>Dan</persName> resolved the dilemma by doing something even more unthinkable—he lent her the computer, and told her his password. This way, if
                    <persName>Lissa</persName> read his books,
                    <orgName type="phrase">Central Licensing</orgName> would think he was reading them. It was still a crime, but the
                    <orgName type="acronym">SPA</orgName> would not automatically fnd out about it. They would only fnd out if
                    <persName>Lissa</persName> reported him.

                </p>
                <p>Of course, if the school ever found out that he had given
                    <persName>Lissa</persName> his own
                        password, it would be curtains for both of them as students, regardless of what
                        she had used it for. School policy was that any interference with their means of
                        monitoring students’ computer use was grounds for disciplinary action. It didn’t
                        matter whether you did anything harmful—the oﬀense was making it hard for
                        the administrators to check on you. They assumed this meant you were doing
                        something else forbidden, and they did not need to know what it was.
                    </p>
                <p>
                    Students were not usually expelled for this—not directly. Instead they were
                    banned from the school computer systems, and would inevitably fail all their
                    classes.
                </p>
                <p>Later,
                    <persName>Dan</persName> would learn that this kind of university policy started only in the
                    <date when="1980">1980s</date>, when university students in large numbers began using computers. Previously,
                        universities maintained a diﬀerent approach to student discipline; they
                        punished activities that were harmful, not those that merely raised suspicion.
                    </p>
                <p>
                    <persName>Lissa</persName> did not report
                    <persName>Dan</persName> to the
                    <orgName type="acronym">SPA</orgName>.
                        His decision to help her led to their
                        marriage, and also led them to question what they had been taught about piracy
                        as children. The couple began reading about the history of copyright, about the
                    <placeName type="phrase">Soviet Union</placeName> and its restrictions on copying, and even the original
                    <name type="phrase">United States Constitution</name>. They moved to
                    <placeName type="phrase">Luna</placeName>, where they found others who had likewise gravitated away from the long arm of the
                    <orgName type="acronym">SPA</orgName>. When the
                    <geogName>Tycho</geogName> Uprising began in
                    <date when="2062">2062</date>, the universal right to read soon became one of its central aims.

                <p>This story is supposedly a historical article that will be written in the future
                    by someone else, describing
                    <persName>Dan Halbert</persName>’s youth under a repressive society shaped by the enemies that use “pirate” as propaganda. So it uses the
                        terminology of that society. I have tried to project it from today so as to
                        sound even more oppressive. See “Piracy,” on p. 99.

                </p>
                <p> The right to read is a battle being fought today. Although it may take 50 years for our present way of life to fade into obscurity, most of the
                    specifc laws and practices described above have already been proposed;
                    many have been enacted into law in the
                    <placeName type="acronym">US</placeName> and elsewhere. In the
                    <placeName  type="acronym">US</placeName>,the

                    <name type="phrase">Digital Millennium Copyright Act</name> (
                    <name type="acronym">DMCA</name>) established the legal
                        basis to restrict the reading and lending of computerized books (and other
                        works as well). The
                    <orgName type="phrase">European Union</orgName> imposed similar restrictions in a
                    <date when="2001">2001</date>copyright directive. In
                    <placeName type="phrase">France</placeName>, under the
                    <name type="acronym">DADVSI</name> law adopted in

                    <name type="acronym">DeCSS</name>, the free program to decrypt video on a DVD, is a crime.

                </p>
                <p>In
                    <date when="2001">2001</date>,
                    <orgName type="phrase">Disney</orgName>-funded Senator
                    <persName>Hollings</persName> proposed a bill called the
                    <name type="acronym">SSSCA</name>
                            that would require every new computer to have mandatory copy-restriction
                            facilities that the user cannot bypass. Following the Clipper chip and
                            similar
                    <orgName type="acronym">US government</orgName> key-escrow proposals, this shows a long-term trend:
                        computer systems are increasingly set up to give absentees with clout control
                        over the people actually using the computer system. The

                <p>The
                    <orgName type="phrase">Republicans</orgName> took control of the
                    <orgName type="acronym">US Senate</orgName> shortly thereafter. They are less tied to
                    <orgName type="phrase">Hollywood</orgName> than the
                    <orgName type="phrase">Democrats</orgName>, so they did not press these proposals. Now that the
                    <orgName type="phrase">Democrats</orgName> are back in control, the danger is once again higher.

                <p>In
                    <date when="2001">2001</date> the
                    <placeName  type="acronym">US</placeName> began attempting to use the proposed
                    <name type="phrase">“Free Trade” Area of the Americas</name> (
                    <name type="acronym">FTAA</name>) treaty to impose the same rules on all the countries in the
                    <geogName>Western Hemisphere</geogName>. The
                    <name type="acronym">FTAA</name> is one of the so-called “free trade”
                        treaties, which are actually designed to give business increased power over
                        democratic governments; imposing laws like the
                    <name type="acronym">DMCA</name> is typical of this spirit. The
                    <name type="acronym">FTAA</name> was eﬀectively killed by
                    <persName>Lula</persName>, President of
                    <placeName type="phrase">Brazil</placeName>, who rejected the
                    <name type="acronym">DMCA</name> requirement and others.
                </p>
                <p>Since then, the
                    <placeName  type="acronym">US</placeName> has imposed similar requirements on countries such as
                    <placeName type="phrase">Australia</placeName> and
                    <placeName type="phrase">Mexico</placeName> through bilateral “free trade” agreements, and on countries such as
                    <placeName type="phrase">Costa Rica</placeName> through another treaty,
                    <name type="acronym">CAFTA</name>.
                    <placeName type="phrase">Ecuador</placeName>’s President
                    <persName>Correa</persName> refused to sign a “free trade” agreement with the
                    <placeName  type="acronym">US</placeName>, but I’ve heard
                    <placeName type="phrase">Ecuador</placeName> had adopted something like the
                    <name type="acronym">DMCA</name> in
                    <date when="2003">2003</date>.
                </p>
                <p>One of the ideas in the story was not proposed in reality until
                    <date when="2002">2002</date>. This is the idea that the
                    <orgName type="acronym">FBI</orgName> and
                    <orgName type="phrase">Microsoft</orgName> will keep the root passwords for your personal computers, and not let you have them.
                </p>
                <p>The proponents of this scheme have given it names such as “trusted computing”
                    and “Palladium.” We call it “treacherous computing” because
                    the eﬀect is to make your computer obey companies even to the extent
                    of disobeying and defying you. This was implemented in
                    <date when="2007">2007</date> as part of
                    <name type="phrase">Windows Vista</name>; we expect
                    <orgName type="phrase">Apple</orgName> to do something similar. In this scheme, it is the manufacturer that keeps the secret code, but the
                    <orgName type="acronym">FBI</orgName> would have little trouble getting it.
                </p>
                <p>What
                    <orgName type="phrase">Microsoft</orgName> keeps is not exactly a password in the traditional sense; no
                            person ever types it on a terminal. Rather, it is a signature and encryption
                            key that corresponds to a second key stored in your computer. This enables

                    <orgName type="phrase">Microsoft</orgName>, and potentially any web sites that cooperate with
                    <orgName type="phrase">Microsoft</orgName>, the ultimate control over what the user can do on his own computer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <name type="phrase">Vista</name> also gives
                    <orgName type="phrase">Microsoft</orgName> additional powers; for instance,
                    <orgName type="phrase">Microsoft</orgName> can forcibly install upgrades, and it can order all machines running
                    <name type="phrase">Vista</name> to refuse to run a certain device driver. The main purpose of
                    <name type="phrase">Vista</name>’s many restrictions is to impose
                    <name type="acronym">DRM</name> (
                    <name type="phrase">Digital Restrictions Management</name>) that users can’t overcome. The threat of
                    <name type="acronym">DRM</name> is why we have established the
                    <name type="phrase">Defective by Design</name> campaign, at
                    <ref target="http://defectivebydesign.org/">DefectiveByDesign.org</ref>.
                </p>
                <p>When this story was frst written, the
                    <orgName type="acronym">SPA</orgName> was threatening small
                    <name type="phrase">Internet service providers</name>, demanding they permit the
                    <orgName type="acronym">SPA</orgName> to monitor all users. Most
                    <name type="acronym">ISPs</name> surrendered when threatened, because they cannot aﬀord to fght back in court. One
                    <name type="acronym">ISP</name>,
                    <orgName type="phrase">Community ConneXion</orgName> in

                    <placeName type="phrase">Oakland</placeName>,
                    <placeName type="phrase">California</placeName>,refused the demand and was actually sued. The
                    <orgName type="acronym">SPA</orgName> later dropped the suit, but obtained the
                    <name type="acronym">DMCA</name>, which gave them the power they sought. The
                    <orgName type="acronym">SPA</orgName>, which actually stands for
                    <orgName type="phrase">Software Publishers Association</orgName>, has been replaced in its police-like role by the
                    <orgName type="phrase">Business Software Alliance</orgName>. The
                    <orgName type="acronym">BSA</orgName> is not, today, an ofcial police force; unofcially, it acts like one. Using methods reminiscent of the erstwhile
                    <placeName type="phrase">Soviet Union</placeName>, it invites people to inform on their coworkers and friends. A
                    <orgName type="acronym">BSA</orgName> terror campaign in
